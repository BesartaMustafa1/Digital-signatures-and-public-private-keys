## Code Explanation
This encryption uses the Hill Cipher method. Hill Cipher is a symmetric encryption algorithm that uses matrix algebra to encrypt and decrypt messages. It is a classic block cipher that transforms a set of characters into another set using matrix operations.
### Dependencies
numpy: For numerical operations and matrix manipulation.
sympy: For handling matrix inversions.
tkinter: For creating the graphical user interface (GUI).
### Matrix Cipher Components
#### Character Conversion Functions:

char_to_num(char): Converts characters to numerical values.
num_to_char(num): Converts numerical values back to characters.
### Message Padding:
pad_message(message, block_size): Pads the message to ensure its length is a multiple of the block size.
Matrix Inversion Modulo:

mod_inv(matrix, modulus): Computes the modular inverse of a matrix.
Message to Vector Conversion:

message_to_vector(message, block_size): Converts the padded message to a vector of numerical values.
### Encryption and Decryption:

encrypt(message, matrix): Encrypts the message using the provided matrix.
decrypt(encrypted_message, matrix): Decrypts the message using the provided matrix.
Graphical User Interface (GUI):

### MatrixCipherGUI: A class to create the GUI for encryption and decryption.
Predefined Matrices
Matrices are predefined for different ranks (2, 3, and 4), which are used for encryption and decryption.
